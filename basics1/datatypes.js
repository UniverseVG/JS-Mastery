  primitive data types

  number => 2^52
  string => ""
  boolean => true/false
  null => standalone value
  undefined => variable without value
  symbol => unique identifier
  bigint => number > 2^53

  Symbols in JavaScript are a primitive data type introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). They provide a way to create unique identifiers that can be used as property keys in objects. Unlike strings or numbers, symbols are guaranteed to be unique, which helps avoid naming collisions when working with objects.

   

  type of null is object and undefined is undefined
  

  converting null to number gives 0, but undefined gives NaN and also string gives NaN, Conversion of  boolean gives 1 for true and 0 for false and object gives NaN
